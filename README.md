# Remote Tools

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites
You will need a web server and PHP configured. Also, I used MariaDb for the database system.
Since this project makes use of PDO you'll need a version of PHP greater or equal to PHP5.1
Finally you can found and [image of the database](sql/db.sql) to import in the [sql folder](sql)

## Making a connection
Before we are able to do anything with our database we first have to make a connection. You can edit the connection parameters in the [functions.php](RemoteTools/functions.php) file
